# Chat-Server-and-Client-Project
A chat server and client application using C++. The project utilized the Winsock2 API for network communication, and involved creating a multithreaded server capable of handling multiple clients simultaneously. Each client could send and receive messages in real-time, ensuring seamless communication.
This project not only enhanced my understanding of network programming but also provided practical experience in handling socket connections, message broadcasting, and multithreaded server design, all developed in Visual Studio.
